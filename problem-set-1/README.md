# John's ice cream shop

John has an ice cream shop.

He sells two kinds of ice cream: Chunky Chocolate and Creamy Pistachio

Chunky Chocolate costs $1.50 a scoop and Creamy Pistachio costs $1.00 a scoop.

There is a line of customers waiting for the cashier to take their orders.

Each customer will order one scoop of ice cream.

The customers get in line at the back. When they get to the front, they get their ice cream and leave the line.

Here is a picture of the line in front of his shop.

Let's think about what questions we might ask about this scenario and how we could answer them.

Here are a few examples:

1. How many people are in the line?
2. How much revenue will John make from these customers.
3. How many people want Chocolate Chunk?

Can you think of a few more questions we could ask about this scenario?

Which questions are easiest to answer? Which are harder? Why?

Finally, how might we represent the scenario in code? Can we create a program that will answer one or more of the questions we thought of?
